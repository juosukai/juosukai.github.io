title: From VMWare Fusion to Bootcamp
---

Every story cannot be a success story, sometimes mistakes need to be mentioned as well.

Earlier in the fall I setup a client with windows 7 on a VMWare fusion machine. The client was using this windows instance to run a specialized [HRV monitoring software](http://www.megaemg.com/products/hrv-scanner/) with external Bluetooth gadgets to get data into the machine. This never worked well enough through the VM, especially the Bluetooth connection needed constant reboots.

We decided to go with bootcamp, and I was presented with a a dilemma: spend another couple of hours setting up the windows machine again, ro find a way to move the vmware setup directly to bootcamp.

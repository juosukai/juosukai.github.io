title: Samba4, ZFS on Linux and mac os x clients
comments: True
---

After quite a bit of testing last year, I got Samba 3.6.x to play pretty nicely with Mac OS X clients. Pretty nicely in this context means that the logon and permissions worked as needed. the performance was decent and office programs and adobe programs worked with files on the share.

After reading about some new things coming to [samba4](http://sambaxp.org/fileadmin/user_upload/SambaXP2014-DATA/wed/track1/Ralph_Boehme-AppledancesSamba.pdf) (thank you Ralph for your comments on the [macenterprise](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/macenterprise) email list), especially in term of of support for mac clients, I decided that some upgrades were needed.

I have used Debian as my primary linux platform for some time now, and I really see no reason to swap. The tools provided by the repositories are solid, and I can always build my own when I need something more cutting edge. In this case, I have been using [debian stable 7.7](http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/7.7.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-7.7.0-amd64-netinst.iso). 

ZFS on linux has been rock solid for me, and provided many incredibly useful tools (autosnapshot, zfs send/receive, growing a FS by replacing drives with bigger disks etc.). I use the one I get from the [zfsonlinux repositories for debian](http://zfsonlinux.org/debian.html).

The version samba4 I am using for the setup below is [samba 4.2.0 rc2](https://download.samba.org/pub/samba/rc/WHATSNEW-4.2.0rc2.txt), together with a specific patch extracted from [https://github.com/slowfranklin/samba/commits/aapl](https://github.com/slowfranklin/samba/commits/aapl) to enable the vfs_fruit functionality.

After a lot of testing I have managed to come up with the following setup which seems to do all the stuff I want it to:

- works with acls on the FS level, so I can manage acls using setfacl
- phenomenal speed for a smb share
- file locking is consistent
- permissions of files created and copied to the share are the same

{% highlight ini %}

	workgroup = WORKGROUP

	vfs objects = recycle
	recycle:repository = /moolok/jako/roskakori
	recycle:versions = true
	recycle:keeptree = yes
	recycle:directory_mode = 660

{% endhighlight %}

There is still wonkiness with this setup:

- Deleting files without the vfs_recyle option will not work, the files are not actually deleted before the client doing the deleting quits the share
- Spotlight will not work with this setup. 
- A separate cron script will be needed to clean up the recyclebin

The second Finmacdmin-meeting was planned at MacSysadmin 2014 in Gothenburg, and mainly arranged by Robin Laurén at [Reaktor](http://www.reaktor.com).

We managed to have several very interesting presentations:

* Joel Manserus from [mcare](http://www.mcare.fi) talked about the AppleCare products
* [Hannes Juutilainen](https://github.com/hjuutilainen?tab=activity) built a local Munki system in just under 15 minutes
* Janne Lehikoinen from [Tieto](http://www.tieto.fi/) talked about git in systems administration

### puppet ja mac-ylläpito
